# Collected-Items  
  
Collected Items is an application to manage home hand storage dedicated to electronic elements, which can be used also to evidence other accumulated items like tools, cosmetics, or jars for winter.  
You can add your categories, locations, and items. Every item can have many locations, and you can also add a file for it, for example, the instruction or photo.
